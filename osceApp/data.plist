Also inspect for signs of gangrene (blackening of the extremities). Look for any changes to hair distribution, and be sure to examine between the toes and under the legs for any ulceration.

Regions of decreased air entry should be noted, and may be due to COPD, plural effusion, pneumothorax, pnuemonia, neoplasm, and pulmonary collapse. Wheezes tend to be louder on expiration, and are usually the result of COPD (low pitch) or asthma (high pitch). Crackles can be defined in their timing. Early inspiratory crackles suggests small airway disease such as COPD. While late inspiratory crackles can be further defined as fine, medium or coarse. Fine crackles are associated with pulmonary fibrosis, medium crackles with left ventricular failure, and coarse crackles with either pulmonary fibrosis bronchiectasis.</string>

						<string>General appearance</string>
						<key>description</key>
						<string>The gastrointestinal examination relies greatly on making astute observations of the patient. From the end of the bed make note of the patients overall appearance. Look for signs of jaundice. This appears as yellow discoloration of the skin from hyperbilirubinaemia. Check for signs of wasting or recent weight loss. Folds of loose skin from the abdomen and limbs may be suggestive of recent weight loss. Check for changes in pigmentation. This may be due to haemoschromatosis, Addison&apos;s disease or an increase in ACTH which leads to increase in melanin production. Changes in mental state may be due to toxic metabolites leading to  hepatic encephalopathy. Finally, make sure the patient is lying flat with their head on a single pillow. This relaxes the abdominal muscles and allows for effective abdominal palpation.</string>

						<string>Large bruises (ecchymoses) may be due to clotting abnormalities. Damage to the liver can result in decreased protein synthesis and a reduction in clotting factors. Obstructive jaundice results in a shortage of bile in the digestive system and may reduce the absorbtion of fat soluable vitamins such as vitamin K which is used in the production of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. Tiny sized bruises (petechiae) may result from chronic alcohol abuse, which can result in thrombocytopenia from a decrease in bone marrow production. </string>

Look for any gum hypertrophy (Vit C deficiency, gingivits, leukaemia, phenytoin, pregnancy) and pigmentation (lead poisoning, antimalarial and OCP drugs, addison&apos;s disease, malignant melanoma). Fetor (bad breath) may be due to poor oral hygiene, while a sweet smell is characteristic of ketosis. Candidiasis presents as creamy white patches in the mouth, caused by the fungal infection of candida albicans. It may spread to the oesophagus and causes dysphagia. It is often due to immunosupression, chemotherapy, broad-spectrum antibiotics, alcohol abuse, and HIV infection.</string>

						<string>Tounge</string>
						<key>description</key>
						<string>A thickened epithelium with bacterial debris and food particles commonly forms a coating of the tounge (particularly on the posterior aspect), and although often worse in smokers it is rarely a sign of disease. Leucoplakia is a white colored thickening of the mouth and tounge mucosa. It is premalignant, with most causes due to poor dental hygeine, smoking, alcohol, sepsis, and syphilis. Glossitis describes the smooth appearance of the tounge, and is due to atrophy of the papillae with possible ulceration in later stages. This often occurs due to nutritional deficiencies of iron, folate, and B-vitamins. Macroglossia can occur in Down syndrome, acromegaly, amyloid deposition, or tumour infiltration.</string>

						<key>description</key>
						<string>The mouth represents the beginning of the gastrointestinal tract, and is the most easily accessible location for examination. Remove any false teeth. Look for any gum hypertrophy (Vit C deficiency, gingivits, leukaemia, phenytoin, pregnancy) and pigmentation (lead poisoning, antimalarial and OCP drugs, addison&apos;s disease, malignant melanoma). Fetor (bad breath) may be due to poor oral hygiene, while a sweet smell is characteristic of ketosis. Candidiasis presents as creamy white patches in the mouth, caused by the fungal infection of candida albicans. It may spread to the oesophagus and causes dysphagia. It is often due to immunosupression, chemotherapy, broad-spectrum antibiotics, alcohol abuse, and HIV infection.</string>

						<string>Tounge</string>
						<key>description</key>
						<string>A thickened epithelium with bacterial debris and food particles commonly forms a coating of the tounge (particularly on the posterior aspect), and although often worse in smokers it is rarely a sign of disease. Leucoplakia is a white colored thickening of the mouth and tounge mucosa. It is premalignant, with most causes due to poor dental hygeine, smoking, alcohol, sepsis, and syphilis. Glossitis describes the smooth appearance of the tounge, and is due to atrophy of the papillae with possible ulceration in later stages. This often occurs due to nutritional deficiencies of iron, folate, and B-vitamins. Macroglossia can occur in Down syndrome, acromegaly, amyloid deposition, or tumour infiltration.</string>

						<string>Spider naevi</string>
						<key>description</key>
						<string>These radiating small vessels appear like spider legs, and range in size up to half a centimetre in diamater. They are often found in regions drained via the superior vena cava; in the arms, neck and chest wall. Pressure applied to the vessel blanches the lesion. A finding of greater two or three spider naevi is likely abnormal. They are most often caused by alcoholic cirrhosis, but may also appear in viral hepatitis, and late in pregnancy. Campbell de Morgan spots appear similar, they are bengin flat red circular lesions which do not blanch on pressure.</string>

						<string>The patient should be lying flat with one pillow under the head and the abdomen exposed. Check for signs of &apos;acute abdomen&apos;, with the patient looking unwell and having shallow breathing due to irritation of the peritoneum. Inspect for scars from previous surgery or trauma. Abdominal distention can be caused by the &quot;F&apos;s&quot;: fat (obesity), fluid (ascities), fetus, flatus (due to bowel obstruction), faeces, &apos;filthy&apos; big tumour. Look for signs of prominent veins, which become engorged due to portal hypertension.</string>

						<key>description</key>
						<string>Reassure the patient and ask to bend the knees slightly, this helps to relax the abdominal wall muscles. Begin palpation across the nine regions beginning with light pressure on each region, before repeating with deep palpation. Look at the patient as you palpate, checking for any signs of tenderness or pain. Guarding occurs when there is contraction of the abdominal muscles, and when done involuntarily suggests peritonitis. Rebound tenderness occurs when the abdominal wall is pressed slowly and then released rapidly. When this causes pain for the patient, it is strongly suggestive of peritonitis.</string>
